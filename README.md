# PRODIGY_CS_Task-4
🚀 Excited to Share My Fourth Internship Task at Prodigitech! 🚀

For my latest project as a Cyber Security Intern at Prodigitech, I developed a keylogger using Python
and the pynput library. This project focused on monitoring and logging keystrokes for security 
analysis and auditing purposes. Here’s a brief overview of the tool:

🔐 Features:

Real-time Keystroke Logging: Captures and logs every key press.
Escape Key Termination: Stops logging when the escape key is pressed.
Logging to File: Saves all keystroke data to a log file for later analysis.
Efficient and Lightweight: Runs in the background without significant resource usage.
Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

Looking forward to more exciting challenges and learning opportunities at Prodigitech! Stay tuned for more updates.
